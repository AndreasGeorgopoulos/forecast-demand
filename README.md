# Forecasting lettuce demand
At this project the daily lettuce demand of four different restaurants of a fast-food chain is forecasted, based on different Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models.

The initial datasets are presented in `asdasd` file. The provided code (`Code_Forecast.R`) depicts:
- Preprocessing: where the historic lettuce demand for each of the four target restaurants is calculated.
- Forecasting modelling (Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models) per restaurant, where the best models are captured based on an n-sample performance comparison and the best candidate among the latter is used to provide the final lettuce demand prediction
