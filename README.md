# Forecasting lettuce demand
At this project the daily lettuce demand of four different restaurants of a fast-food chain is forecasted, based on different Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models.

The initial datasets are not provided due to confidential agreement with the client. However, the final preprocessed datasets of lettuce demand per each target restaurant are present in the `Lettuce_Demand.zip` file. The provided code (`Code_Forecast.R`) depicts:
- Preprocessing: where the historic lettuce demand for each of the four target restaurants is calculated.
- Forecasting modelling (Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models) per restaurant, where the best models are captured based on an in-sample performance comparison and the best candidate among the latters is used to provide the final lettuce demand forecast.
